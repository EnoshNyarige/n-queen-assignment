# n-queen csp-assign
### Implementing the n-queen problem using MIN-CONFLICT


- The Program takes an input for the desired board size .(n) 
- The program also needs the user to insert the row positions for the queens in the boardconfiguration
    - I had an issue with the input afterwards, the input is inverted -- starts from bottom to top. Check the sample image

- *As started in the handout, a queen is represented by an `x`, while the other locations are represented by `o`.*

# Steps to compile and execute this Program

- Ensure that you are in same directory as the main.py file 
- Type `python main.py` to run the main file. 
- Follow the prompts in the CLI
    - Enter the desired size of the board
        - n cannot be less than 4.
    - Enter the row positions of the queens in each column
- If there is a solution available within 1000 iterations, the program will print out the result.
